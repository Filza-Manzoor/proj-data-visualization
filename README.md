COVID-19 quickly evolved from an epidemic to a pandemic. USing data visualization techniques we will figure out the the virus spread and how it happened so quickly and broadly starting with the first case discovered in December 2019. In this projectt, we will use the records and data tools to show how the coronavirus epidemic developed into a global pandemic.

All the datasets required are in csv files. The code and decision derived is from the .ipynb file.
